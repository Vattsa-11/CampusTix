- **Event Management**: Track and manage created events
- **Analytics**: View basic analytics for event performance

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing the structure of the application
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the entire application
- `script.js` - JavaScript file handling all application logic and functionality
- `README.md` - Project documentation
